                <h2>VII. Winnings and Determination of Winnings</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Winnings on bets with fixed odds are calculated by multiplying the odds with the wager.</li>
                    <li>Winnings are automatically credited to the betting account. In individual cases, the credit of winnings may be postponed until the official result report has been published.</li>
                    <li>The pay-out of winnings may be deferred for up to 30 days.</li>
                    <li>Provided the outcome is certain all bets will be decided and evaluated. {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }} only accepts the results that occur during the event. Any changes that are made after this time have no influence on the evaluation of the betting event. Bets that have already been decided at the time of interruption (live bets, half-time bets, match period bets, over/under bets, first goal etc.) are evaluated without regard to the time of the interruption or resumption of play. If the event is cancelled during extra time or penalty shoot-out, the result after the scheduled 90 minutes play (including added injury or stoppage time) applies.</li>
                    <li>If a sporting event that was cancelled, interrupted or withdrawn is restarted or continued by the end of the following day, local time, the stake will apply to the newly restarted/continued betting event. The bet also remains valid if the event is replayed/continued or played at a neutral venue. If the match is not restarted or continued, it will be declared invalid. This shall not apply to betting markets previously offered as live bets and already evaluated (for example winning a set, winning a game, over/under-bets).</li>
                    <li>If a bet is declared "invalid" (e.g. cancellation of match) this bet shall be evaluated with 1.0 odd as “won”. For individual bets this means that the user receives an amount equivalent to his stake. On combination bets all the odds are adjusted accordingly and the combination bet is still won when all other bets contained therein are also won. Possible fees, for example on individual bets, are not refunded.</li>
                    <li>League matches or matches within a tournament such as Cup matches which are ended by the referee before completion of the scheduled playing time, will be evaluated according to the final score at the time, if the referee declares the match legal with the final whistle and the match is added to the official tables and is not replayed or continued at a later stage.</li>
                    <li>                8. {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }} assumes no liability for input, transmission and/or evaluation errors. If obvious errors occurred when entering betting odds and/or evaluating betting results (e.g. typing errors. incorrect match pairing, obvious mix-ups with regard to odds, incorrect handicaps, obviously wrong number of goals for over/under bets) – also after the event, {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }} reserves the right to make retrospective corrections or to declare the bets concerned to be invalid.
                    </li>
                    <li>{{ env('BRAND_NAME') }}. also does not assume any guarantee that the information services made available are correct, complete or up-to-date, e.g. odds lists or Live score. Only the amount confirmed and displayed by {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }}. is considered the wager.</li>
                    <li>Under specific circumstances, {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }} offers a so-called "buy-back" for certain betting slips. The customer has no claim to sell back his betting slip to {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }}</li>
                    <li>Any attempt to collude or intent to participate, directly or indirectly, in any collusion scheme in the course of any betting activity is strictly prohibited. Likewise, the use of any aids such as but not restricted to scripts, bots or spiders is strictly prohibited.</li>
                    <li>All transactions are checked for possible money laundering activity. {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }}. reserves the right to report the customer and any suspicious activity on his/her account to the relevant authorities and freeze the funds. {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }}. also reserves the right to close the relevant account and confiscate the funds.</li>
                    <li>If there is any suspicion of finance, betting and race manipulation {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }} reserves the right to block the pay-out for the respective race or sporting event until a court of arbitration for sport or an ordinary court decides that neither betting nor race manipulation has occurred. Without judicial clarification only the stake will be refunded.</li>

                    <li>The {{ env('BRAND_NAME') }}. doesn’t accept cash outs when the player did not play through their entire deposit amount at least one time.

                    <li>Special betting rules apply to certain types of sport and betting markets. Customers are required to initially take note of these special betting rules because they have preference over the General Betting Rules.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the general and special betting rules some markets have specific rules which can be found next to the respective market. This is indicated by an information symbol which pops up when the mouse is hovered over the respective market.</li>

                    <li>The result after normal game time applies for all sports. Possible extra time or penalty shoot-outs do not affect the evaluation of winnings. Exceptions to this are made known either at betting markets or in special rulings for the sports.</li>
                    <li>If the party on which the bet has been placed does not start regardless of the reasons but the event itself goes ahead the bet has been lost. This applies to all sports bets. However, if the entire betting event does not take place the bets will be declared invalid.</li>
                    <li>For the "goal scorer" type of bet to be valid, the player wagered on must participate in the game at the start of the event; otherwise the bet shall be invalid. Subsequent substitutions shall not be taken into account in this context. The exception to this rule is: Bets placed on the “1st Goal scorer” market remain valid even if the player does not start or does not take part in the match.</li>
                    <li>Dead heat: If two or more participants in a sporting event are declared winners, the betting odds will be divided accordingly.</li>

                            <li>In general ante-post bets are offered for the turnout of a major event (tournament).
                                For example, the bet could be offered in the form of a question:</li>

                            <li>Ante-post bets are offered regardless of whether or not all participants are listed or take part. All stakes for ante-post bets are lost if the participant or team, on which the bet was placed fails to take part or gives up.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>The actual result is based on the last game/event (e.g. final match or last day of play) at midnight (local time of the event). Changes to the result made after this point – regardless of the reason – have no effect on the evaluation of the betting event.</li>
                    <li>If two or more participants share a particular final position, the rates/odds are divided by the number of participants sharing the position.</li>
